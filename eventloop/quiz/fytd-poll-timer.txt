- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/poll_timer.js.
- Will the order of execution change if the delay in the while loop is changed from 10s to 150s? Why or why not?
- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?

Yes the order changes, 
this happens becouse the async operation gets call back before the timer relases the timout function into pending checkouts.
