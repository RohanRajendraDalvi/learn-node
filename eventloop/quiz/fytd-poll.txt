- In eventloop/poll.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.
function foo gets executed first,
and then console log done is called,
then the Async op is performed.

this happens becouse the someAsyncOperation goes into the timer waitlist while the other 2 functions get called immediately.
